# dYdX Web Application QA Assessment

This repository contains the work I have completed as part of the QA assessment for the dYdX web application. The work is divided into two distinct objectives:

- **Bug Hunting Assessment**: Evaluate the application for potential functional, UI/UX, and performance issues, and propose an ongoing bug-hunting strategy.
- **Automated Test Case Development**: Develop an automated regression test case for a key functionality.

## Objective 1: Bug Hunting Assessment

- **Directory**: `Objective-1-bug-hunting`

### Key Functionalities Explored:
- Stop Loss and Take Profit functionalities
- Withdraw & Transfer functionalities
- Portfolio screen

### Bug Hunting Strategy:
I have created a detailed QA Bug Hunting Strategy document that outlines the key activities, metrics, and resources needed to efficiently identify, document, and resolve bugs within the application.

### Bug Reports:
The bug template can be found here: `.github/issue_templates/bug.md`
Included in this repo are real bug reports based on my exploration of the application. This are under issues in the repo.


## Objective 2: Automated Test Case Development

- **Directory**: `Objective-2-automated-tests`

### Instructions to Run the Tests:
Details on how to run the tests and more are in the `README.md` of `Objective-2-automated-tests`
